##There is no easy way to say this
Jekyll and Bootstrap are a pain in the ass to figure out. I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying it's really hard for someone of my skill level.

###They good news:
In stumbling through the styles of this blog, I earned a slightly deeper understanding of how Jekyll is laid out. So now, I can start making new styles on my own. I can also start to move away from bootstrap into my own designs.

    <h1>WOOHOO!</h1>
    <p> Unlike 99% of the blogging platforms out there, I can post code snippets through this!</p>

###The bad news:
My blog not only looks horrible, but it's mostly using the styles from the Jekyll Bootstrap framework. While I like some parts of it, I don't like most of it.

###Moving Forward:
I am going to work at making my homepage look like what I want it to. I'm not completely ok with how my posts look, but one step at a time.
